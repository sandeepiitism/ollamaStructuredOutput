This project demonstrates how to use Ollama with Llama 3.2 models to convert unstructured data (text or images) into structured JSON. It includes parsing text, analyzing images, creating a Flask API backend, and building a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript user interface for seamless data management. Automate your workflow and eliminate manual data parsing! ðŸš€
